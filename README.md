# CrUX Dash Launcher

Launch directly into your own customized CrUX Dashboard.

1. Go to https://rviscomi.github.io/crux-dash-launcher/
2. Submit a valid origin
3. Get redirected to your own dashboard

**What is a valid origin?** `https://www.example.com`. Protocol (http or https), optional subdomain (www), and domain (example.com). No trailing slash (/) or file path (/rviscomi/crux-dash-launcher).

**Does it work for all websites?** No. The CrUX dataset tracks about 6 million popular websites monthly. If your website isn't popular enough, it won't be in the dataset. Don't ask how popular is popular enough, we won't say.

**How is this different from using [g.co/chromeuxdash](https://g.co/chromeuxdash)?** When you go through the connector, you're generating your own personal copy of the CrUX Dashboard. This tool, on the other hand, launches you into a read-only version of a shared public dashboard.
